In CSS Grid, auto and fr are both values used to define the size of grid tracks (rows and columns), but they behave differently:

1. auto Behavior: The 'auto' value sizes the grid track (row or column) based on the content within it. The track will grow or shrink just enough to accommodate the content, with no extra space added.

Use Case: Use auto when you want the size of the grid item to be determined by its content. If the content is larger, the track will expand; if the content is smaller, the track will shrink.

    grid-template-columns: auto auto auto;

In the example above, each column will be just wide enough to fit its content.

2. fr Behavior: The fr (fractional unit) value is a flexible unit that distributes available space in the grid container. Each fr represents a share of the remaining space in the grid after considering other tracks.

Use Case: Use fr when you want to divide the remaining space in the grid evenly (or proportionally) among the tracks. It’s ideal when you want columns or rows to grow or shrink proportionally to fill the available space.

    grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;

In this example, the available space is divided into 4 parts (1fr + 2fr + 1fr = 4fr). The first and third columns get 1 part each, and the second column gets 2 parts.

Comparison:

* Content vs. Available Space: 'auto' sizes based on content, while 'fr' sizes based on the available space in the container after other fixed sizes or 'auto' tracks are accounted for.

* Flexibility: 'auto' is rigid in the sense that it strictly follows the content size. 'fr' is flexible, distributing space based on the ratio of fr units defined.

Example Comparison:

Comparison:
=> Content vs. Available Space: 'auto' sizes based on content, while 'fr' sizes based on the available => space in the container after other fixed sizes or auto tracks are accounted for.

Flexibility: 'auto' is rigid in the sense that it strictly follows the content size. 'fr' is flexible, distributing space based on the ratio of 'fr' units defined.

Example Comparison:

    .container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: auto 1fr 2fr;
    }

    *   First column (auto): Will be just wide enough to fit its content.
    *   Second column (1fr): Will take one part of the remaining space.
    *   Third column (2fr): Will take two parts of the remaining space.

This setup means that after the first column sizes itself to fit the content, the remaining space is divided between the second and third columns, with the third column getting twice as much space as the second.

Visual Illustration:

    * Imagine a grid container that’s 600px wide:

    * If the content in the 'auto' column is 100px wide, the remaining 500px will be split between the '1fr' and '2fr' columns, with the '1fr' column getting 166.67px and the '2fr' column getting 333.33px.

    * In contrast, if you used auto auto auto, each column would size to fit its content, potentially leaving unused space in the container if the content doesn’t fill it.
